Overview: 

The To-Do List App is a web-based application built using PHP and MySQL that allows users to create and manage their personal or work-related tasks.

The main purpose of the system is to help users organize their daily activities by letting them add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks in a simple interface.

 

This system focuses on simplicity and usability — users can quickly log in, add new tasks with deadlines or priorities, and update them as needed. It’s an alternative to pen-and-paper reminders, making task management accessible anywhere with an internet connection.
